# split_landing

In this project, I created a split landing page. I formatted it to represent a hypothetical store for the Playstation 5 and the Xbox Series X consoles. When users hover over one console on the split screen, the screen stretches out to 75% (while the other one recedes by 25%, and vice versa).
